# Urbanwood
An Augmented Reality (AR) based E-commerce website 

The objective of the project is to aid the lack of enough visual information faced by the customers while shopping online. The offered solution is to implement Augmented Reality (AR). We choose Furniture store as the domain. The customers can browse products just like a regular online shop. Moreover, they can pick any furniture and see how it looks in their room or anywhere in real-time. WebXR and Model Viewer is used to display 3D files in the real-world environment through a smartphone camera. HTML, CSS, and JS are used for front-end and Python and Django for back-end.
